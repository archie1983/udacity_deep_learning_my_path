Batches
Implement get_batches to create batches of input and targets using int_text. The batches should be a Numpy array with the shape (number of batches, 2, batch size, sequence length). Each batch contains two elements:

The first element is a single batch of input with the shape [batch size, sequence length]
The second element is a single batch of targets with the shape [batch size, sequence length]
If you can't fill the last batch with enough data, drop the last batch.

For example, get_batches([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 3, 2) would return a Numpy array of the following:

[
  # First Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 1  2], [ 7  8], [13 14]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 2  3], [ 8  9], [14 15]]
  ]

  # Second Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 3  4], [ 9 10], [15 16]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 4  5], [10 11], [16 17]]
  ]

  # Third Batch
  [
    # Batch of Input
    [[ 5  6], [11 12], [17 18]]
    # Batch of targets
    [[ 6  7], [12 13], [18  1]]
  ]
]
Notice that the last target value in the last batch is the first input value of the first batch. In this case, 1. This is a common technique used when creating sequence batches, although it is rather unintuitive.
